Also, all hotel aspects mentioned in the reviews have been annotated as such. In addition, we provide nearly 200k further hotel reviews without manual annotations. The corpus is free-to-use for scientific purposes, not for commercial applications. In version 2, the annotated XMI files have been changed according to a new underlying type system that is more easily extendable.

In version 2, the annotated XMI files have been changed according to a new underlying type system where each quality dimension is represented by an own annotation. This annotation contains not only the majority score of the respective dimension (as in version 1), but also the mean score and the scores of all annotators. We recommend to use version 2. In case you publish any results related to the Dagstuhl-15512 ArgQuality corpus, please cite our EACL 2017 <a href="#publications">paper</a> on argumentation quality. </p>},

  synopsishtml =        {<p> The Webis Clickbait Corpus 2017 (Webis-Clickbait-17) comprises a total of 38,517 Twitter posts from 27 major US news publishers. In addition to the posts, information about the articles linked in the posts are included. The posts had been published between November 2016 and June 2017. To avoid publisher and topical biases, a maximum of ten posts per day and publisher were sampled. All posts were annotated on a 4-point scale [not click baiting (0.0), slightly click baiting (0.33), considerably click baiting (0.66), heavily click baiting (1.0)] by five annotators from Amazon Mechanical Turk. A total of 9,276 posts are considered clickbait by the majority of annotators. In terms of its size, this corpus outranges the <a href="https://webis.de/data/webis-clickbait-16.html">Webis Clickbait Corpus 2016</a> by one order of magnitude. The corpus is divided into two logical parts, a training and a test dataset. The training dataset has been released in the course of the <a href="http://www.clickbait-challenge.org">Clickbait Challenge</a> and a download link is provided below. To allow for an objective evaulatuion of clickbait detection systems, the test dataset is available only through the Evaluation-as-a-Service platform <a href="http://www.tira.io/">TIRA</a> at the moment. On TIRA, developers can deploy clickbait detection systems and execute them against the test dataset. The performance of the submitted systems can be viewed on the <a href="http://www.tira.io/task/clickbait-detection/dataset/clickbait17-test-170720/">TIRA page of the Clickbait Challenge</a>. </p>},
